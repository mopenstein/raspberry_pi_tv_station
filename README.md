# raspberry_pi_tv_station

Python2 and PHP scripts to emulate and automate a fully functional broadcast TV station

Designed and tested only on the Rasperry PI 3b+ using A/V out. 

This script is for use with the Raspberry Pi utilizing OMXPlayer and DBus to play tv shows with commercial interruptions at set points in time.

I use this to play old 80's tv shows along with 80's tv commercials for that authentic 80's vibe.

I also wrote a companion program in C# for Windows: https://github.com/mopenstein/VideoSplit

It relies on https://github.com/willprice/python-omxplayer-wrapper to play videos
