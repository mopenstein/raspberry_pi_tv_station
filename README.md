# raspberry_pi_tv_station
Python and PHP scripts to emulate and automate a fully functional broadcast TV station

This represents 5+ years of work. Unfortunately I did not document every step I took modifying the OS in order to acheive the end result. You can download an image of my system here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mcrtyx4xzs52lga/tv_station_2020_11_03.rar?dl=0

After downloading and burning the image to an SD card you can download the latest version of the script above. 

Designed and tested only on the Rasperry PI 3b+ us A/V out.
