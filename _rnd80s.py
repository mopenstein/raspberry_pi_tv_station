#!/usr/bin/python
# version: 102.2
# version date: 2026.02.09
#
#	Added plugin system (see radio.py for example)
#		Plugins are stored in a user-defined directory set in settings.json
#		Plugins are python files that register keywords and handle those keywords when triggered in channel definitions
#	Fixed bumper generation error
#	Began expanding Channels - more will come later
#		This will require changes to the MYSQL database. A 'channel' field must be added to the 'played' table:
#			Name	Type	Collation	Attributes	Null	Default	Comments	Extra	Action
#			6	channel	varchar(100)	utf8mb4_general_ci		Yes	NULL	
# 
#	Added ability to have AND/OR logic in "between" time ranges
#	New digit-level time tokens added to "time" ranges in "between" Settings:
#	New settings added "minimum-before-repeat" to programming blocks to allow tracking of minimum time before a programming schedule block can be triggered *note: not persistent between restarts yet*"
#	Main loop has been broken into smaller functions for easier maintenance and future expansion
#	Added new functions and constants to "chance" evaluations: 
#		bound(x, low, high) - restricts x to stay within the range [low, high], returning the nearest in-range float
#		tan() - returns the tangent of a float input (in radians), completing the trigonometric set alongside sin() and cos()
#		stamp - current timestamp as a float (seconds since epoch), useful for time-based ramps and decay logic
#
#
#
# 	Server side changes:
#
#	"balanced-video" setting has been greatly improved to better handle missing files, remove ghost entries, balance more accurately, and when a new file is added, it is given priority to be played next and its play count is balanced with other files
#
# settings version: 0.995
#
#	Tokens added to "between" Settings:
#		"%TENSHOUR%": Returns the current tens digit of the current hour in 12-hour format (0 or 1)
#		"%UNITSHOUR%": Returns the current units digit of the current hour in 12-hour format (0-9)
#		"%TENSMIN%": Returns the current tens digit of the current minute (0-5)
#		"%UNITSMIN%": Returns the current units digit of the current minute (0-9)
#		"%TOPTENSMIN%": Returns the current tens digit of the current minute if it is 0 or 3, otherwise returns an empty string (used for top of the hour (0) or top-half-hour (3) minute triggers)
#
#	"minimum-before-repeat" functionality added to programming blocks to allow setting a minimum time before a video can be repeated
#		- "minimum-before-repeat": minimum time in seconds or list of a range of numbers before a programming schedule can be triggered
#		Examples:
#			"minimum-before-repeat": 120 // this entry cannot repeat for at least 120 seconds
#			"minimum-before-repeat": [60, 120] // a random number between 60 and 120 seconds will be selected and this entry cannot repeat for at least that time
#
#	"plugin_directory" setting added to settings.json to specify the directory where plugins are stored
#
#	"between", specifically and only the, "times" setting now supports AND/OR logic in the "times" section (dates and years remain OR only).
#		- if a top-level item in the "times" array is a list of lists, each inner list must match (AND)
#		- if a top-level item in the "times" array is a single list, it is treated as an OR condition
#		- if any top-level item matches, the entire "times" condition is considered a match (OR)
#		Example:
#			"between": { "dates": [ ["Sep 01", "Nov 30"] ], "times": [ [ ["03:00PM", "04:45PM"], ["%HOUR%:"%TOPTENSMIN%0%AMPM%", "%HOUR%:"%TOPTENSMIN%5%AMPM%"] ] ] },
#				* This means the date must be between Sep 1 and Nov 30 AND the time must be between 3:00PM and 4:45PM AND also between [HH:00AM/PM and HH:05AM/PM OR HH:30AM/PM and HH:35AM/PM] (where HH is the current hour in 12-hour format)
#
#	***REMOVED***
# 
# 		"log_only_latest" setting. Broken from get go. Will be later handled by a php script on the web server side.
