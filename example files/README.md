All video files to be played should have their audio levels normalized. The video files above have been marked with \_NA\_ to show they have been volume corrected.

All videos should be tagged in their filename's with the length of the video in seconds rounded up to the second. The Popeye file has been marked with %T(365)% showing it is 365 seconds long. The video commercial's filename has been marked with %T(30)% because it is 30 seconds long.
